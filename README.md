Static analysis of smart contracts relies on the coverage of the control flow graph (CFG). Symbolic execution can explore CFG paths, but it faces the problem of path explosion. Although existing learning-based frameworks use machine learning and manually designed features, there is still room for improvement in covering control flow jumps. Their features lack adaptation to the characteristics of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode and cannot effectively capture textual semantics such as bytecode sequences and constraints. We propose SymFlow, an optimized EVM bytecode symbolic execution framework. SymFlow introduces 10-dimensional symbolic execution features (SEF) customized for the EVM runtime context, and combines them with 3-dimensional control flow embedding features (CFEF) derived from large model embedding to transform non-numerical code patterns into rich vectors. When fusion of features, SymFlow uses coverage-driven dynamic weight adjustment and residual optimization to generate universal feature vectors and enhance state-semantic fusion. Compared with advanced baselines, SymFlow improves the state selection accuracy of training regression models by 13.9-25.6% and CFG coverage by 4.9-19.5%, which has been verified on the SmartBugs dataset. Its scalable design establishes a new approach for CFG analysis of smart contracts.
